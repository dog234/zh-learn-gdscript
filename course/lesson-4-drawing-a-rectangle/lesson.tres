To make it draw, you give it a list of instructions: on each code line, you call one specific function.

We prepared several functions for you:

- [code]move_forward(pixels)[/code] makes the turtle move forward over a given distance in [i]pixels[/i].  
- [code]turn_right(degrees)[/code] makes the turtle turn clockwise by a precise amount of [i]degrees[/i].
- [code]turn_left(degrees)[/code] works the same as [code]turn_right(degrees)[/code], except the turtle turns counter-clockwise.

You'll use these functions the same way you used [code]rotate()[/code] before.

The turtle draws a white line as it moves. We'll use this line to draw shapes.

For example, to move the turtle 200 pixels, you would write [code]move_forward(200)[/code]."
